This file works through the basic principle behind Total Field Inversion (TFI)

Paper source:
Liu et al., Preconditioned Total Field Inversion (TFI) Method for Quantitative
Susceptibility Mapping


Use:
- TFI is used in QSM MR image processing to optimize the picture.
- reduce systematic errors
- traditional QSM has
        -> background field removal
        -> local field inversion (LFI)

- improve QSM quality in presence of large susceptibility changes
- brain, air-filled sinus, skull, fat

Methods:
- single optimization problem
- simultaneously estimates
        background fields
        local fields
    -> prevents error propagation from background field removal to QSM
- uses new preconditioner to increase computational speed
